                            <p>
                                Gone are the days when online transactions were clumsy and insecure. Today, modern payment gateways offer seamless, encrypted, and instant processing capabilities that have democratized access to global markets for businesses of all sizes.

                            <p className="md:mb-8 mb-4">
                                From simple credit card processing to integrating digital wallets and cryptocurrencies, the scope of what a payment gateway handles has expanded dramatically. This evolution is not just about technology; it's about customer experience.

                                Consumers demand speed and security. A study shows that 40% of users abandon their cart if the checkout process is too complicated. Payment gateways solve this by offering one-click checkouts and biometric authentication.
